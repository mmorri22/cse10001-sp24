    "    \n",
    "Unless you have an accommodation from the Sara Bee Center or under quarantine you must take this Exam in the lecture room at the designated class time.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Me and the Teaching Assistants will hand out exams 5 minutes prior to the beginning of class. Students may begin them at 9:25am and when they have put their non-permitted items away. You must hand in your Exam when I indicate time is up. Continuing to work on the exam after time is called will result in disqualification of your Exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exam Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems on the Exam will be similar in format to the Homework problems. You will not be asked to write and compile code. (You can be asked what an issue is with a code segment based on an error message)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This exam is closed book: You may not use any website, books, HW solutions, Hogwarts Owls, voodoo magic, other kinds of magic, smoke signals, or your class notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are caught using any unauthorized resource, you will receive an automatic 0 on the Exam and a referral to the Notre Dame Academic Honor council."

    "These set of problems are longer than the actual exam. But if you can solve these problems independent of the keys or your notes, you will have set yourself up well for success on the Exam.\n",
    "\n",
